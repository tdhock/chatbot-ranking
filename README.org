[[file:2021-04-02-read-data.R]] reads three new data files from Ana:

[[file:user_preference.csv]]

[[file:frames_counts.csv]]

[[file:DD_counts.csv]]

[[file:raw.R]] reads data from raw files in
https://github.com/chavesana/chatbots-register/tree/master/Text%20modification/R%20package/surveystats/data-raw
and we see that 

#+begin_src R

        value count
1: TRANSLATED  1572
2:   ORIGINAL  3146
3:       NONE    77
#+end_src

There are file IDs in column names, but they do not correspond to the
file IDs in counts_diff.csv, why?

[[file:user_preference.R]] reads data and does some simple consistency checks.

1. It may be useful to have the choice=NONE data as well, can you
   please add those rows?

2. To learn nonlinear ranking models we need features for each
   sentence, but the curent data only has difference features, right?
   Can you please provide the sentence specific features for each
   pair?

Just to make sure I am interpreting the file correctly, these are the 36 difference feature column names right?
#+begin_src R
> grep("choice|data|social|PID|construct|G", names(user_pref), value=TRUE, invert=TRUE)
 [1] "private_vb"      "that_del"        "contract"        "vb_present"
 [5] "pro_2"           "pro_1"           "sub_conj_caus"   "disc_particle"
 [9] "pro_nom"         "coord_conj_cls"  "prep_final"      "nn_all"
[13] "prep"            "jj_attr"         "tt_ratio"        "word_length"
[17] "pro_3"           "wh_rel_subj"     "nn_nom"          "adv_time"
[21] "mod_pred"        "vb_suasive"      "sub_conj_cond"   "conj_advl"

So to learn nonlinear models I would need a new data table with 36
columns for original features, and 36 columns for modified
features. For easy interpretation can you please prefix these column
names with original_ and modified_ for example original_private_vb and
modified_private_vb etc?

3. I don't really understand the likert score columns (social*) -- is
   this related to the output (choice column) somehow? can you please
   explain?

It is not related to the choice. These are questions that the user
answered about themselves and how they feel about chatbots (e.g., I
like having small talk with chatbots). In our experiment, these
personal effects were not relevant for the outcome.

4. so the missing PID values mean that there are fewer participants in
   Frames (145) than in DailyDialog (178) right? (I see PID1 to PID178
   columns but some with missing values)

Yes, the missing values means that Frames had less participants than
DailyDialog. Data were collected in two different points in time for
each of these two corpora.

5. is there a column which has an ID number for each sentence pair?
   that may be useful for cross-validation (train on some sentences,
   see if the model can predict well on new sentences)

I do have the id for individual sentences, I guess I removed them when
building this data as well. I'll add them back for the new dataset
that I'll share with you soon (maybe over the weekend, my classes are
killing me!!)
